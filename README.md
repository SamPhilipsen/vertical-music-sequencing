# Don't look!! This isn't finished yet!!!

### Description

This project is a showcase of how vertical msuic sequencing works in videogames. Vertical sequencing is a technique used in sound design where instruments are added/removed from the soundtrack or the volume changes based on what's happening in the game. This helps with making the game feel more (or less) intense.

In this showcase you're walking through a luxurious train while there's music playing in the background. This starts off with just a few instruments, but the fancier the train car, the more intense the music gets. It's not a big showcase, so feel free to relax and listen to the tunes while you're strolling through the train.

### [TODO] Video

In the future there will be a video that guides you through the process of how to make this
yourself.

### [TODO] Research

In the future there will be a link to the research that was used to design this showcase.
